Note: Python script is written using Python3, therefore, Python3 interpreter is required. 

Sample command:

- python checkmypass.py pwd1 pwd2 .... 

This script tells if the password-s was previously leaked in some hack, and that perhaps you should consider changing it or not, since it can be easily hacked again in a dictionary attack.
